Had an error in line 193 of framing.php but had already committed all the stages since.
The error has been fixed now and prints the correct quotation message (error in printing out the delivery for the excluding VAT condition).
This would have been an error from possibly Stage B onwards.

Line 191 I added the number_format() function to the postage price.

I've had some errors in commits and lost some of my code hence why I've had to make these new amendments.
